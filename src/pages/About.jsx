      <p>
        I'm currently an undergraduate at Princeton in an accelerated
        track studying Computer Science. Currently I'm helping build
        backend machine learning pipelines and advising with strategy at
        <span> Vytal</span>
        , a startup I helped start with a few friends back in high school.
        <br />
        <br />
        On campus, I'm primarily involved with pursuing research in the 
        field of Human-Computer Interaction and working at
        <span> Prospect Student Ventures</span> (Princeton's student-run VC),
        as the Director of Founder Support. In my free time, I enjoying training for triathlons (swim, bike, run),
        lifting, reading, and following the latest trends in tech.
