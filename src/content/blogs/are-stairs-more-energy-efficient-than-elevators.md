When comparing stairs and elevators in terms of energy efficiency, stairs are significantly more energy-efficient. Using stairs requires no electrical energy, relying solely on human physical effort. This not only conserves energy but also provides health benefits such as improved cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength.

On the other hand, elevators consume electrical energy to operate. While modern elevators are designed to be more energy-efficient, they still require a considerable amount of energy, especially in high-rise buildings with frequent usage. Additionally, elevators need maintenance and occasional repairs, which adds to their overall energy footprint.
